# Reinforcement_Learning_tech_for_Autnomous_Cars
This project explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to control an autonomous car in a simulated environment. We fine-tuned a reinforcement model using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithms to enable the car to learn optimal driving policies and navigate through complex scenarios.
