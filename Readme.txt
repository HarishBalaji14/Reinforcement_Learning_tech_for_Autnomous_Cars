Project Overview

This project explores the application of reinforcement learning techniques to control an autonomous car in a simulated environment. We fine-tuned a reinforcement model using Deep Q-Network (DQN) and Double Deep Q-Network (DDQN) algorithms to enable the car to learn optimal driving policies and navigate through complex scenarios.

Key Features

Reinforcement Learning Framework: We designed a reinforcement learning framework that utilizes Q-learning, DQN, and DDQN algorithms to train the autonomous car to make decisions based on rewards and penalties.
Simulator Integration: We integrated the framework with a simulated environment, allowing the car to interact with the environment and receive feedback in the form of rewards and penalties.
Fine-Tuning: We fine-tuned the DQN and DDQN models using various hyperparameters and techniques, such as experience replay, target networks, and exploration strategies, to improve the car's performance.
Evaluation Metrics: We evaluated the performance of the trained models using metrics such as cumulative reward, episode length, and collision rate.
Technical Details

DQN and DDQN Algorithms: We implemented the DQN and DDQN algorithms using PyTorch, leveraging the power of deep learning to learn complex driving policies.
Simulation Environment: We used the OpenAI Gym library to create a simulated environment for the autonomous car, allowing us to test and evaluate the trained models.
Hyperparameter Tuning: We performed hyperparameter tuning using a combination of grid search and random search to find the optimal hyperparameters for the DQN and DDQN models.
Results

Our results show that the fine-tuned DQN and DDQN models are able to learn effective driving policies and navigate through complex scenarios, achieving high cumulative rewards and low collision rates.
